# Cloud Computing
For this course our team was responsible for creating a cloud architecture to be deployed on AWS. For this project we decided on creating a model based on chest X-rays to predict if the patient has Covid-19 or healthy. This repository shows the front end intetrface that will take in an image and the VGG model will predict if the patient has covid or Viral pneumonia or Normal Chest X-Ray.
